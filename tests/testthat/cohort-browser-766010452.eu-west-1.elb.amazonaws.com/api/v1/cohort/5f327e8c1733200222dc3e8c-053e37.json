(Please include tests for blood in the stool/faeces or a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy)\"\" If the participant activated the Help button they were shown the message:     Screening tests for bowel or colorectal cancer include:  - FOBT (faecal occult blood test) - this is when you    are given a set of cards and asked to smear a part    of your stool on three separate occasions onto the    cards and then return the cards to be tested for    blood.  - Sigmoidoscopy - a tube is used to examine the lower    bowel. This is usually done in a doctor's office    without pain relief.  - Colonoscopy - a long tube is used the examine the    whole large bowel; you would usually have to drink    a large amount of special liquid to prepare the    bowel; and you would be given a sedative medication    for the procedure.     \"",
