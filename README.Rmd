**cloudos** R package makes it easy to interact with Lifebit's CloudOS <https://cloudos.lifebit.ai/> platform in the R environment.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **cloudos** from [GitHub](https://github.com/lifebit-ai/cloudos/) at this moment. (Will be listed on  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) as well)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) { install.packages("remotes") }
  remotes::install_github("lifebit-ai/cloudos")
```

## Usage

Bellow are given the demonstration of how the **cloudos** package can be used.

### Load the library

```{r}
library(cloudos)
```

### Setup login details

To interact with the cloudos server, it require few login details.

Note: If no `base_url` given the default is https://cloudos.lifebit.ai/

```{r}
cb_base_url <- "http://cohort-browser-dev-110043291.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api"
my_auth <- "your_apikey"
my_team_id <- "your_team_id"
# OR from environment variable stored in a ~/.Renviron file
my_auth <- Sys.getenv("test_cloudos_apikey")
my_team_id <- Sys.getenv("test_cloudos_team_id")
```

### Connect to CloudOS

Lets create a cloudos object with the login details, which can help us connect to cloudos server.

```{r}
my_cloudos <- cloudos::connect_cloudos(base_url = cb_base_url,
                                       auth = my_auth,
                                       team_id = my_team_id)
my_cloudos
```
## Application - Cohort Browser

Cohort Browser is part of Lifebit's cloudos offering. Lets explore how to interact with this in R environment.

### List Cohorts

To check list of available cohorts in a workspace.

```{r}
cohorts <- cloudos::cb_list_cohorts(my_cloudos)
head(cohorts,5)
```

### Create a cohort

To create a new cohort. 

```{r, eval=F}
my_cohort <- cloudos::cb_create_cohort(my_cloudos,
                                       cohort_name = "Cohort-R",
                                       cohort_desc = "This cohort is for testing purpose, created from R.")
my_cohort
```

### Get a cohort

Get a available cohort in to a cohort R object. This cohort object can be used in many different other functions.

```{r}
my_cohort <- cloudos::cb_load_cohort(cloudos = my_cloudos, 
                                     cohort_id = "5f9af3793dd2dc6091cd17cd")
my_cohort
```

### Get samples table

Get all the samples (participants) table for a cohort with phenotypic filters applied.

```{r}
cohort_samples <- cloudos::cb_get_samples_table(cloudos = my_cloudos, 
                                                cohort = my_cohort)
head(cohort_samples, 5)
```

### Get genotypic table

Get all the genotypic table for a cohort.

```{r}
#cohort_genotype <- cloudos::cb_get_genotypic_table(my_cloudos, my_cohort)
cohort_genotype <- cloudos::cb_get_genotypic_table(cloudos = my_cloudos)
head(cohort_genotype, 5)
```

### Explore Filters

#### Search phenotypic filters

Search for phenotypic filters based on a term.

```{r}
all_filters <- cloudos::cb_search_phenotypic_filters(cloudos = my_cloudos, 
                                                     term = "cancer")
head(all_filters, 5)
```
Lets choose one filter from above table

```{r}
# apply this first row filter
my_phenotypic_filter <- all_filters[1,]
my_phenotypic_filter
```

#### Apply phenotypic filter

We can get statistic of sample numbers in a cohort for which a filter is applied.

```{r}
# phenotype filter
cohort_with_filters <- cloudos::cb_get_filter_statistics(my_cloudos, 
                                     cohort = my_cohort, 
                                     filter_id = my_phenotypic_filter$id)
cohort_with_filters
```

We can get number of total participants after applying a filter.

```{r}
# filter participants
total_participants_with_filter <- cloudos:::cb_filter_participants(my_cloudos,
                                                cohort = my_cohort, 
                                                filter_id = my_phenotypic_filter$id)
 
total_participants_with_filter
```

### Apply and Save a filter

Save a filter into the database.

For this a `filter_query` is required.

`filter_query` is a list of different **phenotypic filter** quires.

Steps to find phenotypic filters - 

- Use `cb_search_phenotypic_filters()` to find a filter based on a term.
- At this time you will be having phenotypic filter id of your choice.
- Check the available filter values/range using `cb_get_filter_statistics()`
- Now use this information to make your `filter_query`

There are two possible type of `filter_query`

- Range based
- Value based

**Range based**

For filter_id = 22

```{r, eval = F}
# A tibble: 1,880 x 3
   `_id`      number total
   <chr>       <int> <int>
 1 1938-12-25      1 44660
 2 1998-07-07      1 44660
 3 2000-12-04      1 44660
 4 2003-12-24      1 44660
 5 2004-07-20      1 44660
 6 2004-10-21      1 44660
 7 2004-11-01      1 44660
 8 2004-11-03      1 44660
 9 2005-01-07      1 44660
10 2005-02-27      1 44660
# â€¦ with 1,870 more rows
```

To make a range based query - `filter_query = list("22" = list("from" = "2015-05-13", "to" = "2016-04-29")`

Here `"22"` is the filter_id and you need to provide the range as a list with `from` and `to`.

**Value based**

For filter_id = 50

```{r, eval = F}
# A tibble: 25 x 3
   `_id`                             number total
   <chr>                              <int> <int>
 1 Daughter                             135 19187
 2 Father                              6864 19187
 3 First Cousin Once Removed             11 19187
 4 Full Sibling                        1876 19187
 5 Half Sibling with a shared Father      4 19187
 6 Half Sibling with a shared Mother     79 19187
 7 Maternal Aunt                         49 19187
 8 Maternal Cousin Brother               12 19187
 9 Maternal Cousin Sister                34 19187
10 Maternal Grandfather                  36 19187
11 Maternal Grandmother                  68 19187
12 Maternal Uncle                        27 19187
13 Mother                              9649 19187
14 Other                                114 19187
```

To make a value based query <- `filter_query = list("50" = c("Father", "Mother"))`

Here `"50"` is filter_id and `c("Father", "Mother")` is a vector of values. 

If you have multiple `filter_query` you can combine them with separated by a coma `,` inside the list. Such as `filter_query = list(filter_query_1, filter_query_2)`

Check the bellow example for the complete function call.

```{r, eval=F}
cb_apply_filter(cloudos = my_cloudos,
                cohort = my_cohort,
                filter_query = list("22" = list("from" = "2015-05-13", "to" = "2016-04-29"), "50" = c("Father", "Mother")))

```

### Get sample filters plot

Get ggplots for all the applied phenotypic filters for a cohort. 

As this based on ggplot objects, this can be customised further. 

```{r}
plot_list <- cloudos::cb_plot_filters(cloudos = my_cloudos, cohort = my_cohort)
library(ggpubr)
ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = plot_list)
```

Individual plots

```{r}
plot_list[[1]]
```

```{r}
plot_list[[2]]
```

Covert ggplot objects to plotly elements (just for demonstration purpose, in markdown plotly don't support.)

```{r, eval=F}
p1 <- plotly::ggplotly(plot_list$filter_id_34)
p1
```

```{r, eval=F}
p2 <- plotly::ggplotly(plot_list$filter_id_2345)
p2
```


### Additional for UI

#### Get samples table for selected rows

Create a RAW data string. This usually generates after selecting participants on UI. (more information will be added how to create this in R)

NOTE: This function will be improved `raw_data` arg is temporary. 

```{r}
new_raw_data <- '{"columns":[{"id":34,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"exact","value":0}},{"id":31,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"exact","value":0}},{"id":52,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"exact","value":0}},{"id":5984,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"avg"}},{"id":5984,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"min"}},{"id":5984,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"max"}},{"id":20001,"instance":0,"array":{"type":"exact","value":0}}],"ids":["5f185b92bf92ed4d3be9637d","5edbdd689d700db709af0c2f","5f185b91bf92ed4d3be9587e","5f185b91bf92ed4d3be95984","5edbdd689d700db709af0c3e","5edbdd689d700db709af0c2b","5edbdd689d700db709af0c2d","5f185b93bf92ed4d3be982e9","5edbdd689d700db709af0c2a","5edbdd689d700db709af0c4d"],"type":"csv","base_url":"http://cohort-browser-766010452.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com"}'
```

Using this above raw data lets extract selected participants.

```{r, eval=F}
df <- cloudos::cb_extract_samples(my_cloudos,
                      raw_data = new_raw_data)
```
