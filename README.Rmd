**cloudos** R package makes it easy to interact with Lifebit's CloudOS <https://cloudos.lifebit.ai/> platform in an R environment.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of **cloudos** from [GitHub](https://github.com/lifebit-ai/cloudos/).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) { install.packages("remotes") }
  remotes::install_github("lifebit-ai/cloudos")
```

We are currently working towards making the package available through [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).


## Usage

Below is a demonstration of how the **cloudos** package can be used.

### Load the library

```{r}
library(cloudos)
library(knitr) # For better visualization of wide dataframes in this README examples
library(magrittr) # For pipe
```


### Configure CloudOS

The cloudos functions will be need set of cloudos configurations for able to connect to API. Lets see different ways of R package will try to find those configurations.

1. From Environment variable
2. From cloudos configuration file

First thing this R-package will look for environment variables - `CLOUDOS_BASEURL`, `CLOUDOS_TOKEN`, `CLOUDOS_TEAMID` and if not found it will try to read from `~/.cloudos/config`.

Three ways to set cloudos environment variables

1. Add them to `~/.Renviron`, which will load the environment variables on beginning of the R-session
2. Add them using `Sys.setenv(ENV_VAR = "env_var_value")`
2. Use the function `cloudos_configure()`, which will create a `~/.cloudos/config` (Recommended way if you are using multiple cloudos clients)


## Application - Cohort Browser

Cohort Browser is part of Lifebit's CloudOS offering. Lets explore how to interact with this in R environment.


### List Cohorts

To check list of available cohorts in a workspace.

```{r}
cohorts <- cb_list_cohorts()
cohorts %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```


### Create a cohort

To create a new cohort. 

```{r}
my_cohort <- cb_create_cohort(cohort_name = "Cohort-R",
                             cohort_desc = "This cohort is for testing purpose, created from R.")
my_cohort
```


### Get a cohort

Get a available cohort in to a cohort R object. This cohort object can be used in many different other functions.

```{r}
other_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(cohort_id = "610ac00edb7c7a1d9d0c309f")
other_cohort
```


### Explore available phenotypes

#### Search phenotypes

Search for phenotypes based on a term. Searching with `term = ""` will return all the available phenotypes.

```{r}
disease_phenotypes <- cb_search_phenotypes(term = "disease")
disease_phenotypes %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```
Let's choose a phenotype from the above table. The "id" is the most important part as it will allow us
to use this phenotype for cohort queries and other functions.

```{r}
# get the first row/phenotype in the table
my_phenotype <- disease_phenotypes[5,]
my_phenotype %>% kable()
```

#### Get distribution of cohort participants for a phenotype

Let's check the numbers of participants across the categories of this phenotype.

```{r}
# phenotype
my_pheno_data <- cb_get_phenotype_statistics(cohort = my_cohort, 
                                     pheno_id = my_phenotype$id)
my_pheno_data %>% head(n=10) %>% kable()
```


### Update a cohort with a new query

A query defines what particpants are included in a cohort based on phenotypes.

Phenotypes can be continuous - in which case a selected range needs to be specified, or they can be categorical - in which case selected categories need to be specified.

#### Continuous phenotype

For phenotype "Year of birth" (with id = 8)

```{r}
# cb_get_phenotype_metadata(8)$name
# "Year of birth"
cb_get_phenotype_statistics(cohort = my_cohort, pheno_id = 8) %>% head(n=10) %>% kable()
```

#### Categorical phenotype

For phenotype "Total full brothers" (with id = 48).

```{r}
# cb_get_phenotype_metadata(48)$name
# "Total full brothers"
cb_get_phenotype_statistics(cohort = my_cohort, pheno_id = 48) %>% kable()

```

#### Simple query

Now let's restrict our cohort to a set of participants based on the phenotypes we explored above.

Simple queries allow us to create a cohort query that combines a list of phenotype criteria according to a logical AND. Let's define a simple query using the following named list-based format (note the phenotype id is quoted):
```{r}
# year of birth: 1965 - 1995 ; AND total full brothers: 1 or 2
simple_query = list("8" = list("from" = 1965, "to" = 1995),
                    "48" = c(1, 2))
```

Let's check how many participants would be in the cohort if we applied this query, but without actually applying it.

```{r}
cb_participant_count(cohort = my_cohort, simple_query = simple_query, keep_query = F)
```

If we're happy that this is a sensible query to apply, we can apply the query to the cohort, making sure to override the previous query by setting `keep_query` to `FALSE`. If we wanted to keep the criteria from the pre-exisitng query and add our new phenotype-based criteria to them we would leave `keep_query` set to the defualt value of `TRUE`.

```{r}
# apply the query
cb_apply_query(cohort = my_cohort, simple_query = simple_query, keep_query = F)

# update the local cohort object with info from the changed version on the server
my_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(my_cohort@id)

# double check that the cohort has th number of participants we expected
cb_participant_count(cohort = my_cohort)
```

We could now further restrict our cohort to include only females (phenotype "Participant phenotypic sex", id = 10) by using `keep_query = TRUE`. In other words, this argument applies a query that looks like "old query AND new query".

```{r}
# apply the query
cb_apply_query(cohort = my_cohort, simple_query = list("10" = "Female"), keep_query = T)

# update the local cohort object with info from the changed version on the server
my_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(my_cohort@id)

# check the number of participants
cb_participant_count(my_cohort)

```


#### Advanced query

We could adjust our previous filter to restrict participants to those who are born from 1965 to 1995 OR have 1 or 2 full brothers as well as being female (`( Total full brothers = 1, 2 OR 1965 < Year of birth < 1995 ) AND Participant phenotypic sex = Female`). We could achieve this with an advanced query which uses a more complicated (but more flexible) nested list format (note the phenotype id is not quoted):

```{r}
adv_query <- list(
  "operator" = "AND",
  "queries" = list(
    list("id" = 10, "value" = "Female"),
    list(
      "operator" = "OR",
      "queries" = list(
        list("id" = 8, "value" = list("from" = 1965, "to" = 1995)),
        list("id" = 48, "value" = c(1, 2))
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Available operators in advanced queries: `"AND"`, `"OR"`, `"NOT"`.

Lets apply this query to our cohort and inspect the distribution of our phenotype of interest in the cohort.
```{r}
# apply the query
cb_apply_query(cohort = my_cohort, adv_query = adv_query, keep_query = F)

# update the local cohort object with info from the changed version on the server
my_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(my_cohort@id)

# view the distribution of disease groups in our cohort
cb_get_phenotype_statistics(cohort = my_cohort, pheno_id = 206) %>% head(n=10) %>% kable()

```


### Retreive the participant table

Now lets get a participant phenotype table with the columns of interest for our cohort.

First we have to update the cohort on the cohort browser server to set what columns will be in the table. Currently the best way to do this is to use (counterintuitively) `cb_apply_query` to add the IDs of the phenotypes of interest as columns.

```{r}
cb_apply_query(my_cohort, column_ids = c(208, 10, 8, 48), keep_columns = T)
my_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(my_cohort@id)

```

Now we can fetch the participant phenotype table which includes these columns.
```{r}
pheno_df <- cb_get_participants_table(cohort = my_cohort,
                                      page_size = cb_participant_count(my_cohort)$count)

pheno_df %>% head(n=10) %>% kable()
```


### Get genotypic table

Get the genotypic table for a cohort (currently only cohort browser version 1 is supported).

```{r, eval=F}
cohort_genotype <- cb_get_genotypic_table(cohort = my_cohort)
cohort_genotype %>% head(n=2) %>% kable()
```
