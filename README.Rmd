**cloudos** R package makes it easy to interact with Lifebit's CloudOS <https://cloudos.lifebit.ai/> platform in the R environment.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **cloudos** from [GitHub](https://github.com/lifebit-ai/cloudos/) at this moment. (Will be listed on  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) as well)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) { install.packages("remotes") }
  remotes::install_github("lifebit-ai/cloudos")
```

## Usage

Bellow are given the demonstration of how the **cloudos** package can be used.

### Load the library

```{r}
library(cloudos)
library(knitr) # For better visualization of wide dataframes in this README examples
library(magrittr) # For pipe
```

### Configure CloudOS

The cloudos functions will be need set of cloudos configurations for able to connect to API. Lets see different ways of R package will try to find those configurations.

1. From Environment variable
2. From cloudos configuration file

First thing this R-package will look for environment variables - `CLOUDOS_BASEURL`, `CLOUDOS_TOKEN`, `CLOUDOS_TEAMID` and if not found it will try to read from `~/.cloudos/config`.

Three ways to set cloudos environment variables

1. Add them to `~/.Renviron`, which will load the environment variables on beginning of the R-session
2. Add them using `Sys.setenv(ENV_VAR = "env_var_value")`
2. Use the function `cloudos_configure()`, which will create a `~/.cloudos/config` (Recommended way if you using multiple cloudos clients)


## Application - Cohort Browser

Cohort Browser is part of Lifebit's cloudos offering. Lets explore how to interact with this in R environment.

### List Cohorts

To check list of available cohorts in a workspace.

```{r}
cohorts <- cb_list_cohorts()
cohorts %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```

### Create a cohort

To create a new cohort. 

```{r, eval=F}
my_cohort <- cb_create_cohort(cohort_name = "Cohort-R",
                             cohort_desc = "This cohort is for testing purpose, created from R.")
my_cohort
```

### Get a cohort

Get a available cohort in to a cohort R object. This cohort object can be used in many different other functions.

```{r}
my_cohort <- cb_load_cohort(cohort_id = "5f9af3793dd2dc6091cd17cd")
my_cohort
```

### Get samples table

Get all the samples (participants) table for a cohort with phenotypic filters applied.

```{r}
cohort_samples <- cb_get_samples_table(cohort = my_cohort)
cohort_samples %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```

### Get genotypic table

Get all the genotypic table for a cohort.

```{r}
#cohort_genotype <- cb_get_genotypic_table(my_cohort)
cohort_genotype <- cb_get_genotypic_table(cohort = my_cohort)
cohort_genotype %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```

### Explore Filters

#### Search phenotypic filters

Search for phenotypic filters based on a term.

```{r}
all_filters <- cb_search_phenotypic_filters(term = "cancer")
all_filters %>% head(n=5) %>% kable()
```
Lets choose one filter from above table

```{r}
# apply this first row filter
my_phenotypic_filter <- all_filters[1,]
my_phenotypic_filter %>% kable()
```

#### Apply phenotypic filter

We can get statistic of sample numbers in a cohort for which a filter is applied.

```{r}
# phenotype filter
cohort_with_filters <- cb_get_filter_statistics(cohort = my_cohort, 
                                     filter_id = my_phenotypic_filter$id)
cohort_with_filters %>% head(n=10) %>% kable()
```

We can get number of total participants after applying a filter.

```{r}
# filter participants
total_participants_with_filter <- cb_filter_participants(cohort = my_cohort, 
                                                filter_id = my_phenotypic_filter$id)
 
total_participants_with_filter
```

### Apply and Save a filter

Save a filter into the database.

For this a `filter_query` is required.

`filter_query` is a list of different **phenotypic filter** quires.

Steps to find phenotypic filters - 

- Use `cb_search_phenotypic_filters()` to find a filter based on a term.
- At this time you will be having phenotypic filter id of your choice.
- Check the available filter values/range using `cb_get_filter_statistics()`
- Now use this information to make your `filter_query`

There are two possible type of `filter_query`

- Range based
- Value based

**Range based**

For filter_id = 22

```{r, eval = F}
# A tibble: 1,880 x 3
   `_id`      number total
   <chr>       <int> <int>
 1 1938-12-25      1 44660
 2 1998-07-07      1 44660
 3 2000-12-04      1 44660
 4 2003-12-24      1 44660
 5 2004-07-20      1 44660
 6 2004-10-21      1 44660
 7 2004-11-01      1 44660
 8 2004-11-03      1 44660
 9 2005-01-07      1 44660
10 2005-02-27      1 44660
# … with 1,870 more rows
```

To make a range based query - `filter_query = list("22" = list("from" = "2015-05-13", "to" = "2016-04-29")`

Here `"22"` is the filter_id and you need to provide the range as a list with `from` and `to`.

**Value based**

For filter_id = 50

```{r, eval = F}
# A tibble: 25 x 3
   `_id`                             number total
   <chr>                              <int> <int>
 1 Daughter                             135 19187
 2 Father                              6864 19187
 3 First Cousin Once Removed             11 19187
 4 Full Sibling                        1876 19187
 5 Half Sibling with a shared Father      4 19187
 6 Half Sibling with a shared Mother     79 19187
 7 Maternal Aunt                         49 19187
 8 Maternal Cousin Brother               12 19187
 9 Maternal Cousin Sister                34 19187
10 Maternal Grandfather                  36 19187
11 Maternal Grandmother                  68 19187
12 Maternal Uncle                        27 19187
13 Mother                              9649 19187
14 Other                                114 19187
```

To make a value based query <- `filter_query = list("50" = c("Father", "Mother"))`

Here `"50"` is filter_id and `c("Father", "Mother")` is a vector of values. 

If you have multiple `filter_query` you can combine them with separated by a coma `,` inside the list. Such as `filter_query = list(filter_query_1, filter_query_2)`

Check the bellow example for the complete function call.

```{r, eval=F}
cb_apply_filter(cohort = my_cohort,
                filter_query = list("22" = list("from" = "2015-05-13", "to" = "2016-04-29"),
                                    "50" = c("Father", "Mother")))

```

### Get sample filters plot (experimental)

Get ggplots for all the applied phenotypic filters for a cohort. 

As this based on ggplot objects, this can be customised further. 

```{r}
plot_list <- cb_plot_filters(cohort = my_cohort)
library(ggpubr)
ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = plot_list)
```

Individual plots

```{r}
plot_list[[1]]
```

```{r}
plot_list[[2]]
```

Covert ggplot objects to plotly elements (just for demonstration purpose, in markdown plotly don't support.)

```{r, eval=F}
p1 <- plotly::ggplotly(plot_list$filter_id_34)
p1
```

```{r, eval=F}
p2 <- plotly::ggplotly(plot_list$filter_id_2345)
p2
```
